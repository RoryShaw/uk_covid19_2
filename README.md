# uk_covid19_2

This repo contains the data and highly inelegant code used in the 'Helena Coronavirus Weekly briefings'. This is so I can learn to use R and GitHub better, you can see if I've made any mistakes and you can help correct them!

# Code
I'm going to put the code in the 'Code' .Rmd file. View it alongside the output in the more friendly 'Code.md' file.

# Data
I use data from the gov.uk dashboard (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) and Public Health Wales (https://public.tableau.com/profile/public.health.wales.health.protection#!/vizhome/RapidCOVID-19virology-Public/Headlinesummary). The download I have used each week is in the dated folders.
